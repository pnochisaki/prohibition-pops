        <h2>About</h2>
        <p><em>Prohibition Pops</em> started with a couple of bartenders and an idea. Every idea starts with a problem.
          Theirs was simple: the grownup popsicle industry was dominated by hollow brands peddling syrupy sweet icicles
          with strange aftertastes. They set out to create an alternative: provide a delicious, high quality popsicle
          for
          grownups that can also be enjoyed like a classic cocktail. They’ve learned that reaching that goal takes
          creativity, experience, and innovation.</p>

        <p>
        <blockquote>A delicious, high quality popsicle for grownups that can also be enjoyed like a classic cocktail
        </blockquote>
        </p>

        <p>A passion project born into a new era of prohibition, husband and wife founders Cody Carney and Cornelia
          Mathis
          somewhat auspiciously delivered their exclusive take on boozy popsicles just as the world began shutting down
          in
          a wave of social distancing and online happy hours. With over three decades of restaurant and bartending
          experience combined, the dedicated little team set out to pioneer a poptail held to a higher standard, made
          with
          quality spirits, fresh juice, and real cane sugar. You won’t find any artificial colorings, dyes or sweeteners
          in these pops. There’s really nothing complicated about it: Better ingredients, better-tasting popsicles.</p>

        <p>By collaborating and applying their knowledge and experience they provided delightfully high-quality
          popsicles.
          On the surface, they’re refreshing goodies for grownups, but they’re so much more than that. Co-founder
          Cornelia
          Mathis shares, “Prohibition Pops are modeled after classic cocktails so you can enjoy them as a frozen adult
          pop
          or poured over ice like a regular cocktail. They are fun and meant to be enjoyed however you like with family
          and friends.” Easy to keep on hand, these adult freezer pops offer enjoyable and portable refreshments anytime
          or anywhere cocktails or frozen treats are needed. Have us at your next pool party. Bring us to a tailgate. Or
          enjoy us melted in a glass by the fire. </p>
          <blockquote>“Prohibition Pops are modeled after classic cocktails so you can enjoy them as a frozen adult pop or poured over ice like a regular cocktail. ”</blockquote>
        <p>They believe that their product will leave you excited and a little nostalgic for a sweeter time. It’s about
          you – retreating to that dreamy, way-back place when you would sit on the sidewalk longing for the icecream
          truck to drive up your street. It’s about softening the lens on your life and remembering when the greatest
          thing that could happen in a day would be when your best friend’s mom interrupted your backyard boredom by
          announcing there were popsicles in the chest freezer, go help yourselves. In every single popsicle they offer
          happiness, community, and a nod to simpler times when the days stretched out long and easy in front of us.</p>
